# Millénaire-[NAME NOT FOUND ALREADY]
**Millénaire add-on that tweaks and eventually fixes some Millénaire incompatibilities with mods.**

This is not a new custom culture, it modifies existing ones. I will maybe support modded ones but my priority is on norman culture for the moment

# Introduction
I discovered a lot of things about how Millénaire cultures customization works and found that we can make this mod even more interesting.

What I do here will eventually get documented in https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-documentation

## What will this add-on do ?

**Highest priority**
* Explain how to fix custom controlled villages not moving to new houses after a moment
* Add fisherman to normans
* Fix some modded blocks preventing placing buildings (considered as dangerous so they won't build)
* Allow larger custom buildings (like farms)
* A workaround for the broken custom controlled grove

**Medium priority**
* Custom goals that makes villagers and children even more alive
  * make children play at specific places (with a new custom building name playground)
* Allow smaller custom buildings (like smaller guard houses)

**Lower priority/unsure :**
* polish generated buildings
  * Replace dirt with a better looking block for some norman townhalls
  * Create a full bandit culture

**unrelated to this project**
* Make 32x textures for villages that marry good with Conquest_ resource pack

## Knowledge requirements
* Know how Millénaire works (my documentation could help with that : https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-fixes/)
* Manipulating files and know what is a directory lol (and things like copy-paste)

## Required mods
* WorldEdit (for bigger custom controlled farms)
* FTBUtils for the nbtedit command (To fix millagers not moving in new houses)

## impacted mods
**These mods can sometimes prevent Millénaire village building because they are not recognized as "buildable" by millagers by default :**

* Dynamic Trees and its addons, like DynamicTreesForestry (please use DramaticTrees or SuperiorTrees that are updated for 1.12.2)
* *Probably* BoP
* *Probably* Forestry
* *Probably* Project Vibrant Journeys
