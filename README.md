# Millénaire-fixes
Millénaire add-on that tweaks and eventually fix some Millénaire incompatibilities with mods when trying to place a building or spawn a village.
Really WIP

Sooooo I discovered a lot of things about how Millénaire cultures customization works and found that we can make this mod even more interesting.

Will be available as soon as I can

Normans will have the priority.

How I do that will be documented in https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-documentation

## What will you do ? 
Allow for larger custom controlled farms
Custom goals that makes villagers and children more alive
A workaround for the broken custom controlled grove
