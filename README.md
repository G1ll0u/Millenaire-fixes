# Millénaire-fixes
### Millénaire add-on that tweaks and eventually fixes some Millénaire incompatibilities with mods.**
*This is not a new custom culture, it modifies existing ones.*

# Introduction
Sooooo I discovered a lot of things about how Millénaire cultures customization works and found that we can make this mod even more interesting.

What I do here will eventually get documented in https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-documentation

## What will it do ?
### Normans will have the priority, first them, then the others**

**Highest priority**
* Fix modded blocks preventing placing buildings (considered as dangerous so they won't build)
* Allow smaller custom buildings
* Allow larger custom buildings (like farms)
* A workaround for the broken custom controlled grove

**Medium priority**
* Custom goals that makes villagers and children even more alive

**Lower priority/unsure :**
* Eventually fix some default Millénaire buildings to make them better integrate to the terrain

## Knowledge requirements
* How Millénaire works
* Files manipulation (copy paste lol)

## Required mods
* WorldEdit

## impacted mods
**These mods  

* Dynamic Trees and its addons, like DynamicTreesForestry (please use DramaticTrees or SuperiorTrees that are updated)
* *Probably* BoP
* *Probably* Forestry
* *Probably* Project Vibrant Journeys
