# Millénaire-fixes
**Millénaire add-on that tweaks and eventually fixes some Millénaire incompatibilities with mods.**

This is not a new custom culture, it modifies existing ones. I will maybe support modded ones but the priority is on norman culture for the moment

# Introduction
Sooooo I discovered a lot of things about how Millénaire cultures customization works and found that we can make this mod even more interesting.

What I do here will eventually get documented in https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-documentation
https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-fixes/wiki/

## What will it do ?
My main gameplay is creating custom controlled villages and assign my own buildings to millagers. But I also play with Millénaire world generation on and noticed problems in both sides, and some can be fixed.

**Highest priority**
* Fix some modded blocks preventing placing buildings (considered as dangerous so they won't build)
* Allow smaller custom buildings
* Allow larger custom buildings (like farms)
* A workaround for the broken custom controlled grove

**Medium priority**
* Custom goals that makes villagers and children even more alive

**Lower priority/unsure :**
* Eventually fix some default Millénaire buildings to make them better integrate to the terrain when generating

**Normans will have the priority, first them, then the others**

## Knowledge requirements
* Know how Millénaire works
* Know how manipulating files and what is a directory tree (and things like copy-paste O:)

## Required mods
* WorldEdit (for bigger custom controlled farms)

## impacted mods
**These mods can sometimes prevent Millénaire village building because they are not recognized as "buildable" by millagers by default :**

* Dynamic Trees and its addons, like DynamicTreesForestry (please use DramaticTrees or SuperiorTrees that are updated)
* *Probably* BoP
* *Probably* Forestry
* *Probably* Project Vibrant Journeys
