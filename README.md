# Millénaire-[NAME NOT FOUND ALREADY]
**Millénaire add-on that tweaks and eventually fixes some Millénaire incompatibilities with mods.**

This is not a new custom culture, it modifies existing ones. I will maybe support modded ones but my priority is on norman culture for the moment

# Introduction
I discovered a lot of things about how Millénaire cultures customization works and found that we can make this mod even more interesting.

What I do here will eventually get documented in https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-documentation


## What will this add-on do ?

### millagers improvements
This add-on will try to make Millénaire more alive, preventing them to wait for hours in townhall. Achieved by tweaking existing millagers goals and adding some aesthetic custom buildings (like a playground place for children).
It tweaks and add goals to millagers to improve village "flow". (like wifes supervising the kids while they play)
It fixes patrols, add fisherman and other unavailable roles to normans.

### mods compatibility
Some mods generate things in the world like custom trees (dynamic trees) or custom blocks (like rocks spawning on ground with PVJ). These blocks can sometimes be recognized as "dangerous" by Millénaire and prevents to build anything on it, so it can make villages impossible to find the place to spawn and simply prevent the player from placing a building on it.

My add-on seems to actually fix that !

#### Actually applies for :
* DynamicTrees (please, use DramaticTrees updated fork)
* Biomes O' Plenty
* Project: Vibrant Journeys
* Forestry

### new custom buildings
It will allow player to create more custom buildings like bigger farms, more guards houses, playgrounds for children etc.

**Highest priority**
* Fix millagers sometimes not marrying because of children having all the same family name (requires FTBUtils)
* Add fisherman to normans 
* Fix some modded blocks preventing placing buildings (considered as dangerous so they won't build)
* Allow larger custom buildings (like farms)
* A workaround for the broken custom controlled grove
* Fix patrols

**Medium priority**
* Custom goals that makes villagers and children even more alive
  * make children play at specific places (with a new custom building name playground)
* Allow smaller/bigger custom buildings (like smaller guard houses, lonely guard house, four guards house)

**Lower priority/unsure :**
* polish generated buildings
  * Replace dirt with a better looking block for some norman townhalls
* tweak some goals for TPS performance

**unrelated to this project**
* Make 32x textures for villages that marry good with Conquest_ resource pack
* Create a full bandit cultur

## Knowledge requirements
### What should I know ?
* Know how Millénaire works (my documentation could help with that but still WIP : https://github.com/G1ll0u/Millenaire-fixes/)
* Manipulating files and know what is a directory lol (and things like copy-paste)

## Required mods
* WorldEdit (for bigger custom controlled farms)
* FTBUtils for the nbtedit command (To fix millagers not moving in new houses)
